# SLAE
Code for SLA32.  
Compile.sh is updated and used for assembling, linking and compiling.  
Assignment 5 contains files from an extra shellcode I created and submitted to exploitDB.  It contains shellcode for copying /root/.bash_history to /temp/his (0755). Since for completing assignemt 5 no creation of files was needed, all files in the 'assignment5' folder are related to the history.nasm code
